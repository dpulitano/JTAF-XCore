Building
=========
XCore uses Maven for build. Please install Maven by downloading it [here](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
```sh
# Clone XCore git repo
git clone git://github.com/FINRAOS/JTAF-XCore.git

# Navigate to the sample project
cd JTAF-XCore/seedProject

# Run install to install necessary dependencies
mvn install
```

Running Tests
==============
XCore uses JUnit to run its tests. To start out, jtaf.properties will need to get [defined](http://finraos.github.io/JTAF-XCore/properties.html) in order to choose what tests to run and how to run them. Running XMLTestDriver with JUnit from your IDE or command line will execute the tests as determined by the [strategy](http://finraos.github.io/JTAF-XCore/strategy.html) in the jtaf.properties run configuration.

Once you're ready to, XCore allows easy setup to run test suites on the CI ([like Jenkins](http://www.jenkins-ci.org/)) by setting run configuration properties as System variables. Setting the run configuration properties as System variables will override what's defined in jtaf.properties.

```sh
# Run verify to run the tests on the CI
mvn verify
```

Requirements
==============
XCore requires Java SE version 7 or above available [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
